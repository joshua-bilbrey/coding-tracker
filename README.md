# Python Tracking

A Tkinter app for keeping track of your daily time spent coding.

This app is made to look sleek and provide you the ability to upload your daily time spent coding to Pixela. From there you can see your coding patterns over time.

Press start to begin the timer, you can pause it by pressing the button again. When you are done with your coding for the day you press the done button. Then you can confirm if the time looks correct before submitting.

Press update other time if you want to adjust a previous date's entry. In the new popup window you can choose the date with YYYYmmdd formula and then either delete the entry or update the minutes spent coding for that day.

I hope you enjoy this!
